## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it responsibly by contacting the maintainers directly via email or private channel.

**Report via:**

- üìß Email: [mathey.academy@gmail.pl](mailto:mathey.academy@gmail.pl)
- üîí Subject: "Security vulnerability report ‚Äì [Savely]"

Please include:

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact or severity
- Suggested mitigation if known

We aim to respond within **48 hours** and will work with you to resolve the issue responsibly before public disclosure.

## 3. Handling Sensitive Data

- Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or any credentials.
- Always store sensitive values in a local \`.env\` file.
- \`.env\` files **must** be added to \`.gitignore\` and never shared publicly.
- Use environment variables for configuration and secrets management.

---

## 4. Dependency Management

- Regularly run:
  \`\`\`bash
  npm audit
  npm outdated
  \`\`\`
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to reduce exposure to known vulnerabilities.
- Avoid using unmaintained or unofficial packages.

---

## 5. Access and Permissions

- Use the principle of **least privilege** when granting permissions.
- Do not share access tokens or private keys across environments.
- Protect all CI/CD secrets (GitHub Actions, etc.) with organization-level policies.

---

## 6. Responsible Disclosure

We follow the [Responsible Disclosure Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).  
If you responsibly disclose a vulnerability:

- You will be credited (if desired).
- We will collaborate on a coordinated public disclosure date.
- We will fix the issue before publicizing the vulnerability.

---

## 7. Additional Security Practices

- Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for all maintainers.
- Use signed commits for release branches.
- Prefer HTTPS over HTTP for all external services.
- Regularly review GitHub security alerts and Dependabot reports.
